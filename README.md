# Sublime-ScopeAlways

**Hello there sublime text 2/3 user!**

If you...

- are writing some code snippets
- are adding a command that is context specific
- are working on a sublime text plugin
- want sublime text's status bar to gyrate with every keystroke

Then do I have the sublime text plugin for you!

**ScopeAlways** adds a command `Toggle ScopeAlways` which you can use to display the scope of the current cursor in the status bar (see below).
