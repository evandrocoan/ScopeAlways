# Sublime-ScopeAlways

**Hello there sublime text 2/3 user!**

If you...

- are writing some code snippets
- are adding a command that is context specific
- are working on a sublime text plugin
- want sublime text's status bar to gyrate with every keystroke

Then do I have the sublime text plugin for you!

**ScopeAlways** adds a command `Toggle ScopeAlways` which you can use to display the scope of the current cursor in the status bar (see below).

    wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
    Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,

    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json

    (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
    Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
    find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
    ```js
    "channels":
    [
        "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
