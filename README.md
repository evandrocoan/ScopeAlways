# Sublime-ScopeAlways

**Hello there sublime text 2/3 user!**

If you...

- are writing some code snippets
- are adding a command that is context specific
- are working on a sublime text plugin
- want sublime text's status bar to gyrate with every keystroke

Then do I have the sublime text plugin for you!

**ScopeAlways** adds a command `Toggle ScopeAlways` which you can use to display the scope of the current cursor in the status bar (see below).

## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up

   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:

   add the following setting to your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file, if it is not already there
